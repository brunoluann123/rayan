I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is oh, la, la, la
It's true, la, la, la
Oh, I should be runnin'
Oh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la, la, la
It felt like oh, la, la, la, yeah, no
Sapphire and moonlight, we danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise, her body fit right in my hands, la, la, la
It felt like oh, la, la, la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is oh, la, la, la
It's true, la, la, la
Oh, I should be runnin'

Oh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is oh, la, la, la
It's true, la, la, la
Oh, I should be runnin'
Oh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la, la, la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall
Oh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Oh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is oh, la, la, la
It's true, la, la, la
Oh, I should be runnin'

Oh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is oh, la, la, la
It's true, la, la, la
Oh, I should be runnin'
Oh, you keep me coming for ya

All along I've been coming for ya (for you)
And I hope it means something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya (coming for you)
Coming for ya (coming for you)
For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I come)
For ya
Oh, I should be runnin'
Oh, you keep me coming for ya
